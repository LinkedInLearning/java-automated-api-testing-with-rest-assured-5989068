## Course Description

In this course, Java Champion Angie Jones dives into the world of automated API testing with Java and Rest Assured and shows you how to ensure your APIs function flawlessly. Learn the essentials of making API requests—GET, POST, PUT, DELETE—and reinforce your understanding of API anatomy. Discover how to send supplementary data, retrieve and parse responses, and validate API outputs against expected results. Delve into handling complex response bodies, serializing request data, and deserializing responses into Java objects. Build your ability to independently test APIs, save time, and reduce manual errors. By the end of the course, you will be equipped to write reliable tests that deliver accurate validations of API interactions.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
